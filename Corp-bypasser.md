Built kind TOR browser framework based in TOR-BROWSER so Firefox with some features:

0. We need to use a USB that have writable protection. We need to find encryption poratble framework for Linux and Windows that do not interacts with corporate protections like Antivirues , DLPs and endpoint protection crap.
1. Being Portable in Linux and Windows (2 executables)
2. To use HAproxy, Foxyproxy similar  to being able to redirect TOR,I2P, Freenet,Zeronet and other hidden services to the proper proxy running simultaneously in the background that not need to be detected as malicious by antivirus.
3. To have installed some security functions addons.
4. To have capability to being update without breaking itself.
5. That would be able to retrieve a CA via wizard and ssh from the Librerouter when insside his LAN to install it in itself for bumping.
6. That has disabled HSTS
7. That is able to detect the proxy from the system or manually alocate credentials to be able to go through corporate networks.
8. Be able to detect filtering in corporate networks.
9. That retrieve the hidden addresses from the clients Librerouter and storage in the initial opening session as a menu to reach home.



a) Windows xp,7,10 portability is required
b) Linux Ubuntu debian portability is required.

3. Initial Task:
Result of analisys of the actual broswer i gave to you in the owncloud: which tools are used?
Find opensource encryption program poratable for the  usb that works in linux and windows
TEST in the USB with writable protection.
Works? Decrypt is portable and not interact with corporate end user protection crap?
Start to use latest version of the TOR browser for linux and windows
Disable hsts in both version
Add engines for i2p, freenet, zeronet, etc
Add proxy redirection capabilities
Test
All good? redirects hidden services to the proper engines and do not act with AV DLP IDS IPS and crappy endpoint solution?
Add proxy use capabilites via using a framweork for wizard that runs firstime the broweser is always opening doing check over the network to reach internet.

1. Result of analisys of the actual broswer i gave to you in the owncloud: which tools are used? - Done.  
2. Find opensource encryption program poratable for the  usb that works in linux and windows - in process.

3. Updated browser on latest version (can send it to you, 60 MB). 
4. Tested it on Linux. Found the reason why doesn't work i2p (report on email).
