Built kind TOR browser framework based in TOR-BROWSER so Firefox with some features:

0. We need to use a USB that have writable protection. We need to find encryption poratble framework for Linux and Windows that do not interacts with corporate protections like Antivirues , DLPs and endpoint protection crap.
1. Being Portable in Linux and Windows (2 executables)
2. To use HAproxy, Foxyproxy similar  to being able to redirect TOR,I2P, Freenet,Zeronet and other hidden services to the proper proxy running simultaneously in the background that not need to be detected as malicious by antivirus.
3. To have installed some security functions addons.
4. To have capability to being update without breaking itself.
5. That would be able to retrieve a CA via wizard and ssh from the Librerouter when insside his LAN to install it in itself for bumping.
6. That has disabled HSTS
7. That is able to detect the proxy from the system or manually alocate credentials to be able to go through corporate networks.
8. Be able to detect filtering in corporate networks.
9. That retrieve the hidden addresses from the clients Librerouter and storage in the initial opening session as a menu to reach home.



a) Windows xp,7,10 portability is required
b) Linux Ubuntu debian portability is required.

3. Initial Task:
Find opensource encryption program.
TEST in the USB with writable protection.
Works? Decrypt is portable and not interact with corporate end user protection crap?
Start to use latest version of the TOR browser for linux and windows
Disable hsts in both version
Add engines for i2p, freenet, zeronet, etc
Add proxy redirection capabilities
Test
All good? redirects hidden services to the proper engines and do not act with AV DLP IDS IPS and crappy endpoint solution?
Add proxy use capabilites via using a framweork for wizard that runs firstime the broweser is always opening doing check over the network to reach internet.
....
 

Questions:
Did you set foxyproxy for I2P manually or it is automated some how?
Also you mentioned during our conversation about some security plugins. What they are?



My plans for tomorrow:
base on my analisys I decided to start from writing a plugin which is redirects to a different network based on websites domain for now it will be i2p and tor.

Today I'm planing to work on an extension for redirect, aslo I will try to find some secure extensions for firefox. Before I installe it I will reach you. I let you know about my progress during the day

I searched secure addons and found Browsec VPN, that encrypts traffic and unlocks sites
I installed nodejs-legacy npm, installed jpm, created an addon skeleton


Please explaine 10th item in your task by details.
